Evan's Arithmetic Program
-------------------------
Instructions are as follows:
Use 1 command, followed by 2 numbers (separated by commas, ex:
SUBTRACT 10 5
ADD 55 120
Commands are:
ADD SUBTRACT MULTIPLY DIVIDE SQUARE CUBE
Other commands: to create a variable, ex:
Variable a 15 (creates a variable named a and sets value to integer 15)
Variable g 77
PRINT VARIABLE a (prints that variable to console)
PRINT ALL VARIABLES (prints all variables)
Also you can do all arithmetic functions on variables, for ex:
a * b (needs spaces in between) or a / g or b + d, etc
Use integers for your numbers, also the program is not case sensitive
Type 'end' at any time to end the program and dump all the code to console
